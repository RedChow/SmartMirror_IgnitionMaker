Smart Mirror using Inductive Automation's Ignition - Maker Edition

The smart mirror is running on a Raspberry Pi 4. I tried running it on a Raspberry Pi Zero, but there just isn't enough processing power to run it smoothly.
This is a living project and as such the screenshots may show different configurations and items.
